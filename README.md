# Econometrics: Methods and Applications

The main objective of the course was to teach learners how to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making.

##### What did I learn from the course?

I was able to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. The course starts with introductory lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice data, and time series data.
